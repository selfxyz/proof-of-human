# Backend

This backend is not used in the on-chain branch.

## Branch Information

- **`main` branch**: Contains the backend implementation for off-chain verification
- **`on-chain` branch**: Uses smart contracts for verification (no backend needed)

If you want to use the backend for off-chain verification, please switch to the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

The on-chain version performs all verification directly through the ProofOfHuman smart contract deployed on Celo Alfajores.
